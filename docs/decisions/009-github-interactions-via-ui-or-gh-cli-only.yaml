title: "GitHub interactions via UI or gh CLI only"
category: development
decision: >
  All interactions with GitHub (issues, pull requests, releases, repository
  settings) must be performed either through the GitHub web UI (by humans)
  or via the gh CLI tool (by AI agents and automation). No direct use of
  the GitHub REST/GraphQL API via curl or custom scripts.
agent_instructions: >
  When interacting with GitHub, always use the gh CLI. Do not use curl,
  octokit, or direct GitHub API calls. Common operations:

  - List issues: gh issue list --state open
  - View issue: gh issue view <number>
  - Create issue: gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "..."
  - List PRs: gh pr list
  - Create PR: gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
  - View PR: gh pr view <number>
  - Check CI status: gh run list

  When asked to work on an issue, first run 'gh issue view <number>' to
  read the full description and comments. Reference issue numbers in
  commit messages using conventional commit format (e.g., feat: add X,
  closes #42). Do not create GitHub Actions workflows or modify repository
  settings without explicit human approval.
rationale: >
  The gh CLI provides a consistent, auditable interface for all GitHub
  operations. It handles authentication via 'gh auth', avoids token
  management in scripts, and produces human-readable output that AI agents
  can parse. Using a single tool for all GitHub interactions reduces the
  surface area for mistakes and makes it easy to audit what agents did.
  This mirrors the principle of using well-maintained CLI tools over
  custom API integrations.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: "Direct GitHub REST API via curl"
    reason: "Requires manual token management, verbose, error-prone for agents"
  - alternative: "Octokit SDK"
    reason: "Adds a dependency, more complex than necessary for CLI-driven workflows"
