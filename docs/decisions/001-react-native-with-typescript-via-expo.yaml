title: "React Native with TypeScript via Expo"
category: architecture
decision: >
  Build the mobile client using React Native with TypeScript, bootstrapped
  via Expo (create-expo-app). Use expo-router for file-based routing.
agent_instructions: >
  All application code must be written in TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
  Use Expo APIs and expo-router for navigation and platform features.
  Do not use Flutter, native Swift/Kotlin, or bare React Native CLI.
  Do not eject from Expo unless explicitly approved by a human.
  When adding new screens, create them as files in the app/ directory
  following expo-router file-based routing conventions.
rationale: >
  React Native with TypeScript maximises code reuse with the OpenCode
  TypeScript ecosystem. Expo provides the best developer experience for
  cross-platform mobile development with managed native modules, OTA updates,
  and simplified build tooling. The trade-off of slightly reduced native
  module flexibility is acceptable for this use case.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: "Flutter with Dart"
    reason: "Different language ecosystem, no reuse of OpenCode TypeScript types and patterns"
  - alternative: "Native Swift + Kotlin (two codebases)"
    reason: "Double the maintenance burden, no type sharing with OpenCode server"
  - alternative: "Bare React Native CLI (no Expo)"
    reason: "More complex setup, manual native configuration, slower iteration — Expo covers our needs"
