title: "GitHub Actions for CI"
category: development
status: proposed
decision: >
  Use GitHub Actions as the CI/CD platform. Workflows will validate ADRs,
  run Biome checks, run tests, and handle releases. Implementation is
  deferred until the app has testable functionality.
agent_instructions: >
  Do not create GitHub Actions workflow files until explicitly instructed.
  When the time comes, place workflows in .github/workflows/ and ensure
  they run: ADR validation, Biome check, TypeScript type checking, and
  any test suites. Use pnpm for all CI steps (with pnpm/action-setup).
  Do not use other CI platforms (Travis, CircleCI, Jenkins, Tekton)
  without updating this decision record.
rationale: >
  GitHub Actions is free for public repositories, has the best ecosystem
  integration with GitHub (issues, PRs, releases), and requires no
  external infrastructure. It aligns with the gh CLI workflow (ADR 009)
  and supports pnpm natively via pnpm/action-setup.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: "Tekton"
    reason: "Requires Kubernetes infrastructure, overkill for a public mobile app repo"
  - alternative: "Self-hosted CI"
    reason: "Unnecessary operational burden for this project"
