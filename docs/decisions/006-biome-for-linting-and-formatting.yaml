title: "Biome for linting and formatting"
category: development
decision: >
  Use Biome as the primary tool for both linting and code formatting.
  Supplement with ESLint only for React Native-specific rules that Biome
  does not cover (e.g., expo-specific lint configs). Biome replaces
  Prettier and handles the majority of ESLint's responsibilities.
agent_instructions: >
  Use Biome for all formatting and general linting. Run 'npx biome check'
  for linting and 'npx biome format' for formatting. Do not install or
  configure Prettier. ESLint should only be used for React Native / Expo
  specific rules (e.g., eslint-config-expo) and should not overlap with
  Biome's rules. When adding new code, ensure it passes 'npx biome check'
  before committing. The biome.json config file is the source of truth for
  code style — do not override formatting in editor configs or other tools.
  If Biome and ESLint conflict on a rule, Biome takes precedence and the
  ESLint rule should be disabled.
rationale: >
  Biome is written in Rust and is dramatically faster than ESLint + Prettier
  (100x+ in benchmarks). It combines linting and formatting in a single tool
  with minimal configuration, similar to how ruff replaced pylint + black +
  isort in the Python ecosystem. Using one tool reduces config complexity
  and eliminates the common ESLint-Prettier conflict issues. ESLint is
  retained only for the small set of React Native-specific rules that
  Biome does not yet implement.
rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: "ESLint + Prettier"
    reason: "Slower, two tools to configure, frequent conflicts between ESLint and Prettier formatting rules"
  - alternative: "ESLint only (with formatting rules)"
    reason: "ESLint's formatting rules are deprecated; the project recommends Prettier or similar"
  - alternative: "Biome only (no ESLint at all)"
    reason: "Would lose Expo-specific lint rules that catch React Native pitfalls; keeping ESLint for just those rules is a reasonable compromise"
