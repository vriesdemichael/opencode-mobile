title: "Long-term planning via GitHub issues"
category: development
decision: >
  All planning that exceeds the scope of a single branch or agent session
  is tracked through GitHub issues. Issues are the source of truth for
  feature requests, multi-step epics, known bugs, and technical debt.
  Agents must not rely on in-context memory or local files for cross-session
  planning.
agent_instructions: >
  When working on something that spans multiple sessions or branches, create
  or reference GitHub issues to track progress. Use 'gh issue create' to
  propose new work and 'gh issue view <number>' to read existing plans.
  Break large efforts into sub-issues or checklists within a parent issue.
  When completing work that resolves an issue, reference it in the commit
  message footer (e.g., 'closes #42'). Do not keep long-term plans only
  in local files, conversation context, or memory — they will be lost
  between sessions. When starting a new session, check open issues with
  'gh issue list --state open' to understand what work is in progress.
  When an issue becomes stale or irrelevant, comment on it explaining why
  and close it.
rationale: >
  AI agent sessions are ephemeral — context is lost between sessions and
  local scratch files may not persist. GitHub issues provide a durable,
  shared, searchable record of planned and in-progress work that survives
  session boundaries. They also enable human oversight of the project
  roadmap and allow multiple agents or humans to coordinate on the same
  codebase without duplicating or conflicting work.
