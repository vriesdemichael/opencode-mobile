title: "Use .tmp directory for agent temporary files"
category: development
decision: >
  All AI agents must use the .tmp/ directory at the project root for
  temporary files, scratch work, and intermediate outputs. This directory
  is gitignored. Agents must never use /tmp, the system temp directory,
  the Desktop, or any location outside the project root for temporary
  files.
agent_instructions: >
  When you need temporary files (downloads, intermediate build artifacts,
  scratch notes, test fixtures, API response dumps, etc.), always write
  them to the .tmp/ directory at the project root. Create .tmp/ if it
  does not exist. Do not use /tmp, %TEMP%, ~/Desktop, or any system
  temp directory — many agentic coding tools lack permissions to access
  those locations. Do not write temporary files to the project root or
  any other tracked directory. Clean up .tmp/ contents when they are no
  longer needed, but do not delete the directory itself or its .gitkeep
  file.
rationale: >
  Many agentic coding tools (sandboxed IDEs, remote containers, CI
  runners) have restricted access to system temp directories like /tmp
  or %TEMP%. Using a project-local .tmp/ directory avoids permission
  issues, keeps temporary files discoverable during debugging, and
  ensures they are excluded from git via .gitignore. The .gitkeep file
  ensures the directory structure is preserved in the repository.
