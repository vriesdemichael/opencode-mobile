title: "Taskfile as task runner"
category: development
decision: >
  Use Taskfile (https://taskfile.dev) as the primary task runner for all development
  commands. Package.json scripts should only be used for lifecycle hooks (e.g. prepare)
  or simple proxies where necessary.
agent_instructions: >
  Define all development tasks in Taskfile.yml. Run them via 'task <task-name>'.
  Do not use make, just, or npm scripts for complex workflows. When adding a new task,
  add it to Taskfile.yml with a description.
rationale: >
  Taskfile is a modern, cross-platform task runner that is faster and more flexible
  than npm scripts. It supports dependencies, parallel execution, and simpler syntax
  for complex operations, avoiding "composite command" strings in package.json.

rejected_alternatives:
  - alternative: "just (justfile)"
    reason: "Less common than Taskfile, custom syntax, would add friction for contributors who don't know it"
  - alternative: "Makefile"
    reason: "Tab-sensitive syntax, poor Windows support, archaic"
  - alternative: "Turborepo / nx"
    reason: "Overkill for a single-package project"
